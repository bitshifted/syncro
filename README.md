# Syncro

*Syncro is part of [AppForge](https://github.com/bitshifted/appforge) platform.*

Syncro is an AppForge module which performs automatic updates of applications. It provides the following
functionality:

* check for updates on application startup
* installs updates if available
* provides visual feedback about the process, thus improving user experience

Syncro is extremely easy to integrate into applications. It requires absolutely no work from developer,
as the [Backstage](https://github.com/bitshifted/backstage) build server automatically includes it and configures it.
